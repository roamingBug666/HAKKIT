Fake Virus Pack for Windows:
Package version: 3.3.0 (19/01/2023) 

By L-Studios.



This pack contains several fake viruses for Windows, none of which are harmful to the computer. However they can be very annoying- they can:
- crash your computer
- shut down your computer
- freeze your computer
- block your computer
- make your operating system and hardware behave in irregular ways
- take over your screen
- take over your keyboard
- give heart attacks
- or even do useful stuff




To launch, double-click on the "Control Panel" file. Do not delete, move or modify any of the files contained in the hakkit_files folder, otherwise it could no longer work, or do so fragmentally (If you're a dev, ignore this). 

These fake viruses are not dangerous for your computer in any way. The control center closes itself after executing a virus, so the script can't be traced that easily.

The password is "H4CK3R", the quick password is "7", then "5"

When I say "your computer", I mean the computer the script is run on.

Use this weapon wisely.

Don't make your little bro cry (too much)
